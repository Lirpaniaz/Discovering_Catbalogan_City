                    <p>
                        The Waray-Waray language is the primarily spoken language in the city. Catbaloganons also recognize Filipino (Tagalog) and English languages as a medium of instruction in schools and offices.
                        The word Catbalogan is said to be derived from the shrub balaug that thrived along the banks of the Antiao River. <br /><br />
                        The citizens of Catbalogan, called Catbaloganons, are peace-loving, friendly and hospitable people, and innately jolly and easy to get along with. Immersing with the people will likewise give one an idea how Catbaloganons make up their daily grinds.
                        The city has long been known as a center for fishery and aquatic resources and prides itself on being a fishing community. Thus, the city's Patron Saint is Saint Bartholomew, the Patron Saint of Fishermen, from whom the concept of Manaragat Festival came from. Manaragat Festival is celebrated every year, during the whole month of August. Catbaloganons are religious people, and always make sure that they dedicate a day for their Patron Saint as a form of giving thanks.
                                                                                                                                                <br /><br />For longer stays, especially during the month of May, expect to go village hopping since it's a party every day. It is considered a mortal sin to decline an invitation during Fiesta celebrations.
