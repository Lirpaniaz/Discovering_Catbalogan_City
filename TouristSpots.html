                    <h2>PIETA PARK</h2>
                    <p>
                        Located adjacent to St. Bartholomew Church and St. Mary's College of Catbalogan, it has a memorial honoring Catbaloganons and four thousand-plus others who perished in the December 1987 tragic collision of the passenger ship MV Doña Paz and the oil tanker MT Vector. Historians describe the Doña Paz tragedy not only as the world's worst ferry disaster but also the worst peace-time maritime disaster in history.
                        The Pieta Park is located adjacent to St. Bartholomew Church. The park has a statue of The Pieta, a statue that depicts the body of Jesus on the lap of his mother Mary after the Crucifixion. It serves as a memorial to honor Catbaloganons and four thousand-plus other who perished in the tragic collision of MV Doña Paz and the oil tanker MT Vector on December 20, 1987.

                <p>
                    Imelda Park is one of Catbaloganons’ favorite places to hang out with friends, families, and kids. Several big trees make the park a great place to play, jog, or just relax and breath some fresh air.

                <h2>THE OBELISK </h2>
                <p>
                    The Obelisk is located at the park in front of the Capitol building. The Obelisk depicts the four major events in Samar’s history: the 1901 Balangiga Encounter during the Philippine-American War (1899–1902); the 1649 Sumuroy Rebellion led by Juan Sumuroy in Palapag against the Spaniards; the arrival of the first Jesuit missionaries to Samar on October 15, 1596; and the August 11, 1841 declaration of Samar as an independent province by Queen Isabella II of Spain.

                <h2>MONUMENT OF RIZAL</h2>
                <p>
                    The monument of Dr. Jose Rizal located at the park in front of Catbalogan City Hall is probably the most unique Rizal monument in the world. This monument, representing a bust of Rizal on the top of his two novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, carried by three muscular men who are all naked except for a leaf that covers their frontal private parts, was sculptured by Miguel Alcazar, a native of Catbalogan.

                    The Church of St. Bartholomew, the Apostle, was built prior to 1760. The old meter-high image of the patron saint, St. Bartholomew, is presently kept in the rectory. Behind the church are remains of the quadrilateral fort traced to Jesuit times.
